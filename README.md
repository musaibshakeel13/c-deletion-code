# Array Element Deletion in C

This program deletes an element from an array at a user-specified index.
After deletion, the remaining elements are shifted to the left and the
updated array is displayed.

## How the Program Works
1. Takes the size of the array from the user.
2. Accepts array elements.
3. Takes the index of the element to be deleted.
4. Shifts elements to the left from the given index.
5. Reduces the size of the array by 1.
6. Displays the array before and after deletion.
